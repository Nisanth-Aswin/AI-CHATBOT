The project is "AI CHATBOT" is first designed using FIGMA tool and then implemented using TAILWIND CSS.
I have designed the homepage and chat interface for the web application.
Here is the FIGMA PROJECT Link "https://www.figma.com/file/iX3jQODfdUoprYsSXJgwsJ/AI-CHATBOT(DESKTOP%2FMOBILE)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=BGKk5UrkK6e8ZaIc-1".
In implementation of tailwind css, in desktop view, the screen is splited into two parts.
The one is left side menu and second is "Welcome homepage" or "Chat interface" as per the index.html and chat.html files.
In the Mobile view, the application is visible in a responsive manner, left side menu is set to absolute and floated over the screen, so that the mobile view contains a single part not as desktop view.
Here is the project deployed link using Netlify.
